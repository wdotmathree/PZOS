### Maintenance tasks
  - Find bugs and clean up code (especially tty and printf)
  - Review and adjust folder structure as needed during future development
  - Safety concerns
  - Thread safety and re-entrancy (especially in memory management)
  - Profile/optimize code

### Development steps
  1. Implement allocators
     1. Test buddy allocator
     2. Think about whether/when we should get rid of Limine's HHDM
     3. What is a slab allocator?
     4. Implement an AVL tree for virtual memory
  2. Make sure our kernel is robust
     1. Investigate libk functions to ensure they are safe
  3. Figure out APIC and/or I/O APIC
     1. For example for keyboard input
  4. How do timers work?
     1. PIT vs. HPET and how to use them
  5. Write drivers for common hardware
     1. When do we break the drivers into loadable modules?
     2. ATA hard drive (may need PCI support)
     3. Does booting off a USB drive work the same as a hard drive?
        1. If not then we also want a USB driver
        2. How can we identify what kind of drive we are booting from?
     4. PS/2 keyboard
  6. Implement a basic file system
	 1. Probably FAT32 at first
	 2. Maybe abstract it into a VFS
  7. Implement a basic shell (first userland program)
     1. Need syscalls for I/O and such
