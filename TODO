### Maintenance tasks
  - Verify memory allocation functions don't return NULL and handle errors gracefully
  - Safety concerns
  - Thread safety and re-entrancy (especially in memory management)
  - Profile/optimize code

### Development steps
  1. Figure out APIC and/or I/O APIC
     1. For example for keyboard input
  2. How do timers work?
     1. PIT vs. HPET and how to use them
  3. Write drivers for common hardware
     1. When do we break the drivers into loadable modules?
     2. ATA hard drive (may need PCI support)
     3. Does booting off a USB drive work the same as a hard drive?
        1. If not then we also want a USB driver
        2. How can we identify what kind of drive we are booting from?
     4. PS/2 keyboard
  4. Implement a basic file system
	 1. Probably FAT32 at first
	 2. Maybe abstract it into a VFS
  5. Implement a basic shell (first userland program)
     1. Need syscalls for I/O and such
